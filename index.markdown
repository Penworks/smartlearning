This is the test repository Git Pages site to allow me to understand the Jekyll process, and how to get used to various jekyllish commands like bundle exec jekyll serve and such. Its super exciting and Im reeeeally pleased cos this knowledge will allow me to make lovely static verisoned websites and basically look very groovy indeed.

1. Trying to build better layout by understanding themes and how they work
2. Trying various themes to see what they look like for the kind of content I'll need in here. That means these pages will look like a dogs dinner for a while
3. Also need to figure out how to do the folder structure for images, custom css, any audio or video etc
4. Whether or not I should run a kind of buindle uninstall for themes I dont like, or just remove them from the config and gemfile and delete the folder in the user/.local/... path
