This is the test repository Git Pages site so allow me to understand the Jekyll process, and how to get used to various jekyllish commands like bundle exec jekyll serve and such. Its super exciting and Im reeeeally pleased cos this knowledge will allow me to make lovely static verisoned websites and basically look very groovy indeed.

1. trying to buld better layout by understanding themes and how they work
2. trying jekyll-theme-horizon-flow first so its gonna look a real mess fo now
