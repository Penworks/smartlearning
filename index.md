This site is about learning journeys situated in the Maltese islands and in the heart of London, UK. It's for learners and practitioners. Learning journeys use smart GPS and AR based apps for access to subject content and discussions. Learners can learn about places and people while out and about in the real world. Our 'About' page has more details. This is a Ph.D. research project based at University of Malta. All material licensed CC BY-SA.

This site accompanied a doctoral research project that is now completed. I defended my PhD successfully in August 2021, after submitting the draft thesis for examination in early November 2020. I have published and continue to publish numerous papers about the research itself and about other aspects that arise out of the research. I have also presented for the past three years at the Human Computer Interaction International conference, in the Distributed, Ambient and Pervasive Interactions track, chaired by Dr H. Patricia McKenna. My Orcid is [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1071-693X](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1071-693X).
