This doctoral research project is now completed. I defended my PhD successfully in August 2021, after submitting the draft thesis for examination in early November 2020. Due in part to Covid I did not graduate until January 2022.

I have published and continue to publish numerous papers about the research itself and about other aspects that arise out of the research. I have also presented for the past three years (update: five years 2020-2024) at the Human Computer Interaction International conference, in the Distributed, Ambient and Pervasive Interactions track, chaired by Dr H. Patricia McKenna. My Orcid is [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1071-693X](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1071-693X).

The project was a very interesting and diverse area to work in, full of flexible and innovative ideas about learning, participatory pedagogy and research, placing learning in the hands of the learners themselves.

I would like to thank everyone who took part, the tutors who devised their journey topic and content, those who supported the gathering of data, and who assisted in analysis.
