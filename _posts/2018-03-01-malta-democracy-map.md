**Malta Democracy Map, By Pen Lister. March 1, 2018. Categories: Maltese Democracy. Tags: maps.**


This is the _**Malta Democracy Smart Learning Journey**_. This journey includes ten locations, beginning at the Unesco sign at City Gate, Valletta, and ending at the Sette Giugno monument in St George's Square. Using the Aurasma mobile app to access augmented reality digital content about each location, learners experience an authentic context for their learning. Edmodo is used for learner collaboration and uploading learner generated content.
