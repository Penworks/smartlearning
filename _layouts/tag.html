layout: default
permalink: /tag/

<!-- get the tag from the url -->

{% assign current_tag = page.url | split: "/" | last %}

<!--
=============================

this works the same for tags

'for post in site.categories...' is' from the snippet for calling a group of catgeroies. To make this work with the category key value in the front matter it must match the title of the page - eg front matter is:

---
layout: category
title: Tutorials and Guides
description: posts in the category 'tutorials and guides' 
permalink: category/Tutorials and Guides
exclude: true  
---

this was the only way I could get this to ork. Im sure someone else who knows a lot more about Liquid in Jekyll can shed more light. 
=============================
-->

<!-- pull the posts from the current tag using current_tag -->
<ul>{% for post in site.tags[current_tag] %}
    <li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{post.title}}</a></li>  
    {% endfor %} </ul>
